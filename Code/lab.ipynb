We define two simple but important functions: `count_cases()` to return the total number of cases in the database, and `search_cases(keyword)` to perform a keyword search against case opinions. Each function is decorated with `@kernel_function`, which registers it as a callable tool within the Microsoft Agent Framework framework. This makes these database operations available to the agent automatically during conversation, enabling the agent to retrieve real-time, grounded information from our dataset.\n",

    "Now that we have created our first plugin, we're ready to assemble and test an initial version of our agent. In this step, we create a default `OpenAIChatPromptExecutionSettings` to define basic settings. We then create an instance of `AzureChatCompletion`, which serves as the underlying communication layer between our agent and Azure OpenAI. Using these components, we instantiate a `ChatCompletionAgent`, providing it a name, a set of behavioral instructions, and a list of available plugins (in this case, just `DatabaseSearchPlugin`).\n",

    "    - For now we are passing in our `DatabaseSearchPlugin` class, we will be creating more PlugIns to enhance the functionality of our agent in the next steps\n",
    "    - Notice the `user_query` variable, and how it is asking how many cases there are, plus about water leaking cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run the cell below using the \"▶\" icon next to the cell.  This invokes the agent and subsequent LLM calls, this may take a few moments to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. After the code runs, notice the following:\n",
    "    - There should have been 2 functions called: `count_cases` and `search_cases`\n",
    "    - This happened because the agent interpreted the prompt and made a decision to call these 2 functions\n",
    "    - Notice how we got back a clear response of 377 cases are in our database.  This was based on our `count_cases` database function giving the LLM grounded truth about our dataset.\n",
    "    - Lastly, notice how we asked for 10 cases, but only got 2.  This is because our `search_cases` function is just the ILIKE operator and not yet using a vector search.  It could only find 2 cases that matching using the basic keyword ILIKE search.  In our next lab sections, we will see how we can improve on this."

    "##### 🧠 *Technical Notes*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, we add a new plugin called `SemanticRerankingPlugin` to increase the precision of our agent’s search results. Instead of relying only on keyword matching, this plugin uses semantic search and re-ranking to evaluate results based on the meaning and intent of the user query.\n",
    "\n",
    "It works in two phases: first, it performs a vector similarity search using Azure OpenAI embeddings to find approximately relevant cases; then, it reorders these using a separate model (e.g., `semantic_relevance`) that scores and ranks the results for deeper semantic alignment. This two-step approach helps the agent prioritize results that are not just textually similar, but also topically and contextually relevant—making it ideal for legal queries where nuance matters. As with other tools, this function is registered using `@kernel_function`, so the agent can intelligently decide when to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ⚙️ *Code Review Tasks*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Review the code:\n",
    "    - Notice the following enhancements:\n",
    "        - This plugin introduces a function called `search_semantic_reranked_cases`, designed to deliver higher-quality search results by understanding the semantic meaning of the query rather than relying on basic keyword matches.\n",
    "        - The function is decorated with `@kernel_function`, which makes it available to the agent as a callable tool-this is how Microsoft Agent Framework enables function calling automatically based on user intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Check out the SQL logic inside the code, notice how it includes two key phases:\n",
    "        - (Phase 1) A vector similarity search using OpenAI-generated embeddings to find top 40 candidate cases.\n",
    "        - (Phase 2) A semantic re-ranking step that uses an external re-ranker model (semantic_relevance) to evaluate and reorder those 40 based on relevance scores.\n",
    "        - This hybrid approach helps ensure that even when the user’s phrasing doesn’t exactly match the database text, relevant results can still be surfaced based on meaning and context.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Observe how this plugin builds on the earlier keyword search:\n",
    "        - The previous `search_cases()` method used `ILIKE` for fuzzy keyword matching. That works for exact or near-exact phrases but misses nuance.\n",
    "        - This plugin improves accuracy and recall, especially for complex queries or abstract legal concepts where keyword overlap may be weak.\n",
    "        - This function will be automatically called by the agent if the prompt includes phrases like \"high accuracy is important\" or contains complex, open-ended search intent.\n",
    "        - For example, a prompt like: \"*Help me find the most relevant cases about tenant water damage, with high accuracy*\" will likely trigger this plugin over the basic one.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Finally, run the code block cell by clicking the \"▶\" button on the left side of the code block.\n",

    "##### 🧠 *Technical Notes*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, we build another advanced plugin, `GraphDatabasePlugin`, that combines vector search with graph analysis to find the most influential cases related to a query topic. The `search_graph_cases` method first uses an embedding-based similarity search to semantically rank cases from the cases table. This ensures that only cases meaningfully related to the query are considered further.\n",
    "\n",
    "After narrowing the results semantically, the query leverages **Apache AGE** - a PostgreSQL extension that enables property graph querying via Cypher syntax. Specifically, it matches citations (relationships between cases) in the `case_graph` graph. By counting the number of incoming edges (citations) for each case, we can rank cases based on their influence or importance within the graph. Cases with more citations are prioritized, resulting in a more nuanced retrieval that considers both semantic relevance and citation authority.\n",

The plugin uses the Open-Meteo Archive API, a free and reliable weather data service.\n",
